# Boozy Blundering

> A game about convincing people you're drunk.

You've only got **one shot** of alcohol in your system - will this be enough to convince four bar patrons that you're off your rockers, or will they see through your lack of intake and oust you?

Originally created for the GM48 Game Jam with a theme of "*One Shot*".

**Warning**: Contains strong language and alcohol use.
